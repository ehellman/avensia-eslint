## Rules documentation

See [`eslint` documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules) for more information about working with ESLint rules.

## CONTRIBUTING

An important note about contributing right now is that there is a problem in the `markdown-magic` package which is currently at `2.6.0`. It has a dependency called `@technote-space/doctoc` that completely removed the possiblity to use `require()` and instead wants `import()`. The package has not been properly updated yet, so if you want to run the `npm run generate-list-of-rules` command, you have to open `node_modules\markdown-magic\lib\transforms\toc.js` and change: https://github.com/DavidWells/markdown-magic/issues/62 and https://github.com/DavidWells/markdown-magic/pull/64 and perhaps https://github.com/DavidWells/markdown-magic/pull/63

```js
// this
const { transform } = require('@technote-space/doctoc')
// to this
const { transform } = import('@technote-space/doctoc')
```

And you should now be able to properly update README.md with your new rules. Follow these topics for updates on the topic: https://github.com/DavidWells/markdown-magic/issues/62
